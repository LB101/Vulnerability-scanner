How to use Vulnerability Scanner ?

Domain Lookup
The domain lookup works by you inputting a domain to be scanned. The domain's IP is resolved and then scanned for open ports via a TCP scan. Found open ports are returned along with their service and version if it is included in the banner.Ports 1-3500 are scanned

Service Lookup
The service lookup lets you check if a service version is vulnerable. It does this by checking the version entered against a list of already known vulnerabilities, mainly from Exploit DB, the biggest collection of vulnerabilities.

WordPress Domain Lookup
The WordPress Domain Lookup works by searching within the HTML for any WordPress tags. It will also return the version of the WordPress plugins if any are found.

URL Fuzzer Lookup
The URL Fuzzer Lookup works by getting a domain and adding common paths to it. For example, domain.com/admin. It then will tell you if that URL is valid.

SQL Checker
The SQL checker works by inputting a URL with a GET parameter. For example, https://domain.com/id=3. It will then replace the parameter value with a payload and check the response to see if the site is vulnerable.

URL Crawler
The URL crawler works by inputting a domain to scan. It will extract all URLs found within the page, then it will check if that URL is within the user inputted domain if so, it will be added to the list of valid URLs. You can use this to try and find URLs with parameterâ€™s that can then be used in the SQL Checker. The URL Crawler will run for 20 seconds please wait for it to finish
