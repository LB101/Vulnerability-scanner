            <h2>Why Use a Website Vulnerability Scanner?</h2>
            <p>A website vulnerability scanner is a crucial tool for ensuring the security of your online assets. Here are some reasons why using a vulnerability scanner is essential:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Identify Weaknesses:</strong> Scanning helps to identify potential weaknesses in your web application or network infrastructure before malicious actors can exploit them.</li>
                <li><strong>Save Time:</strong> Automated scanners can efficiently analyze your website for vulnerabilities, saving time compared to manual testing.</li>
                <li><strong>Comprehensive Testing:</strong> Vulnerability scanners can perform comprehensive tests, checking for common security issues such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and more.</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Monitoring:</strong> Regular scans help in continuous monitoring, ensuring that new vulnerabilities are detected promptly.</li>
                <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Many industries and regulations require regular security assessments. Using a vulnerability scanner helps in meeting compliance requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Protect Customer Data:</strong> By identifying and fixing vulnerabilities, you protect sensitive customer data from potential breaches.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Integrating a website vulnerability scanner into your security strategy is a proactive approach to safeguarding your digital assets and maintaining a secure online presence.</p>
        
            <h2>Domain Lookup</h2>
            <p>The domain lookup works by you inputting a domain to be scanned. The domain's IP is resolved and then scanned for open ports via a TCP scan. Found open ports are returned along with their service and version if it is included in the banner.</p>
        
            <h2>Service Lookup</h2>
            <p>The service lookup lets you check if a service version is vulnerable. It does this by checking the version entered against a list of already known vulnerabilities, mainly from Exploit DB, the biggest collection of vulnerabilities.</p>
        
            <h2>WordPress Domain Lookup</h2>
            <p>The WordPress Domain Lookup works by searching within the HTML for any WordPress tags. It will also return the version of the WordPress plugins if any are found.</p>
        
            <h2>URL Fuzzer Lookup</h2>
            <p>The URL Fuzzer Lookup works by getting a domain and adding common paths to it. For example, domain.com/admin. It then will tell you if that URL is valid.</p>
        
            <h2>SQL Checker</h2>
            <p>The SQL checker works by inputting a URL with a GET parameter. For example, domain.com/id=3. It will then replace the parameter value with a payload and check the response to see if the site is vulnerable.</p>
      </div>
